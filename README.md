# What are Message Cursors?

## Types of Message Cursors

Store-based cursors are used by default to handle persistent messages.

VM cursors are very fast, but cannot handle slow message consumers.

File-based cursors are used by default to handle non-persistent
messages. They are useful when the message store is slow and message
consumers are relatively fast.
